🚀 Just built a fun and interactive Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
This project supports two game modes:

🎮 Player vs Player

🤖 Player vs Computer (AI)

🧠 The AI currently makes random moves, and I plan to enhance it using smarter algorithms like Minimax in future updates.

💡 Key features:

Sleek, responsive UI with gradient backgrounds

Game status updates and visual feedback

Reset functionality and mode toggle

Fully playable on desktop and mobile browsers
